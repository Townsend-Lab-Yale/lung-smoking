* Objective

To perform a multi-gene epistasis analysis of as big of a LUAD dataset
as we can assemble (WGS+WXS+TGS), evaluating the impact of smoking on
the set of mutations expected to contribute to progression, after
mutation of TP53 and KRAS.

* Data decisions

- TCGA has smoking as pack years. It has NA values but not 0. We will
  be assuming that NA means no smoking, i.e., that there was
  information for smoking for all participants
