#+CATEGORY: luad

* Objective

To perform a multi-gene epistasis analysis of as big of a LUAD dataset
as we can assemble (WGS+WXS+TGS), evaluating the impact of smoking on
the set of mutations expected to contribute to progression, after
mutation of TP53 and KRAS.

* Data decisions

- TCGA has smoking as pack years. It has NA values but not 0. We will
  be assuming that NA means no smoking, i.e., that there was
  information for smoking for all participants

* Genes to take into account for M>4 analysis

From Michael Klein's CRSO
(https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209810), these
pairs have interactions:

- CDKN2A + TP53
- RB1 + TP53
- KRAS + TP53
- CDKN2A + EGFR
- BRAF + TP53
- NF1 + TP53

So we should consider CDKN2A, TP53, RB1, KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and NF1.

* TODO [0/2] Before publishing                                      :waiting:

- [ ] Remove access to the files at misc.cidma.us/data and provide
  instructions on how to download each file that are is not accessible
  via cBioPortal or synapse.

- [ ] Check with Stephen status of package lift_coords and change it
  from the requirements (currently requires access to a private repo).

* Future analyses

- See effect of smoking person years

- [ ] Presentation

  + pan-data wildtype for the three most common genes

  + flux vs selection difference

One slide, in wild-type three most common genes

Top three means: selections and fluxes (could be 6?)

  + section: smoking vs wild-type

Flux vs selection in smoking
another in nonsmoking
in wild-type

  + what happens next TP53+KRAS vs wildtype

flux TP53+KRAS compared to wildtype
selection TP53+KRAS compared to wildtype
smoking and nonsmoking


* Notes for presentation

No epistasis
- Top 3 genes pan: 'EGFR', 'STK11', 'KEAP1'       (last two not in nonsmoking)
-         smoking: 'EGFR', 'STK11',        'RYR2'
-      nonsmoking: 'EGFR',                        'BRAF', 'SPATA3'

Epistasis from 110:
- All top 3 only 'RYR2' in 'no epistasis'
- All top 3 = 8 genes only 'COL11A1' in both smoking and pan_data
- All top 3, none of them are included in nonsmoking for no epistasis

Epistasis from normal:
- All top 3 only 'RYR2' and 'EGFR' in 'no epistasis'
- All top 3 = 5 genes only 'COL11A1' in both smoking and pan_data
- All top 3, none of them are included in nonsmoking for no epistasis
- 'EGFR' not in nonsmoking (have to investigate why)

Two genes I removed because I do not trust the flux estimate:
- CSMD3
- TTN
I'll rerun the epistasis analysis for those
