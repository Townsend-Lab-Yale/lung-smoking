* Objective

To perform a multi-gene epistasis analysis of as big of a LUAD dataset
as we can assemble (WGS+WXS+TGS), evaluating the impact of smoking on
the set of mutations expected to contribute to progression, after
mutation of TP53 and KRAS.

* Data decisions

- TCGA has smoking as pack years. It has NA values but not 0. We will
  be assuming that NA means no smoking, i.e., that there was
  information for smoking for all participants

* Genes to take into account for M>4 analysis

From Michael Klein's CRSO
(https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209810):

CDKN2A + TP53
RB1 + TP53
KRAS + TP53
CDKN2A + EGFR
BRAF + TP53
NF1 + TP53

So CDKN2A, TP53, RB1, KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and NF1

* Future analyses

- See effect of smoking person years
